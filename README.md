API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. This API framework is developed using REST Assured and Cucumber. REST Assured is a Java library that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing powerful, maintainable tests for RESTful APIs. Cucumber is an open source library, which supports behavior driven development. To be more precise, Cucumber can be defined as a testing framework, driven by plain English text. It serves as documentation, automated tests, and a development aid â€“ all in one.
